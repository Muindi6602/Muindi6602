# Joseph Muindi

**Full-Stack Web Developer | Security-Driven Coder | Tech Enthusiast**

Welcome! I'm Joseph Muindi, a passionate full-stack developer who thrives on building modern, secure, and scalable web applications. I enjoy working across the stack, but my true strength lies in backend development—especially using the latest PHP versions alongside frameworks and patterns that promote maintainability and security.

## 🧠 About Me

- I love clean, efficient code and take inspiration from frameworks like Laravel when designing backend systems—even when coding from scratch.
- I stay up-to-date with modern PHP and the latest best practices in web security, architecture, and testing.
- I’m currently working with **Next.js (App Router)** for modern, fast frontend applications paired with secure backend APIs.
- I constantly experiment with code, frameworks, and tools that enhance developer experience and application performance.
- I'm especially curious about **RNG (Random Number Generation)** and how it applies to fair gameplay and finance-related tech.
